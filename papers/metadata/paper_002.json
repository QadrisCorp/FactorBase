  "abstract": "This paper examines the consistency and sources of mutual fund performance. Using a sample of 1,892 diversified equity mutual funds from 1962 to 1993, we find that the four-factor model that includes momentum (UMD - Up Minus Down) largely explains persistence in returns. Common factors in stock returns and investment expenses almost completely explain persistence in equity mutual funds' mean and risk-adjusted returns. Hendricks, Patel, and Zeckhauser's (1993) 'hot hands' result is mostly due to the one-year momentum effect of Jegadeesh and Titman (1993).",

  "notes": "Extended Fama-French three-factor model by adding momentum factor (UMD). The Carhart four-factor model (Market, Size, Value, Momentum) became a standard benchmark for performance evaluation. Demonstrated that momentum is a persistent factor in stock returns."
