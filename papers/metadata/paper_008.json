  "abstract": "Momentum in individual stock returns emanates from momentum in factor returns. Most factors are positively autocorrelated: the average factor earns a monthly return of 1 basis point following a year of losses and 53 basis points following a positive year. Factor momentum explains all forms of individual stock momentum. Stock momentum strategies indirectly time factors: they profit when the factors remain autocorrelated, and crash when these autocorrelations break down. Our key result is that momentum is not a distinct risk factor; it aggregates the autocorrelations found in all other factors.",

  "notes": "NBER Working Paper No. 25551. 本文提出 Factor Momentum 概念，認為動量效應來自於因子報酬的自相關性，而非獨立的風險因子。研究涵蓋 20 個因子，發現平均因子在正報酬年度後月報酬 52bp，負報酬年度後僅 2bp。Keywords: factor momentum, momentum factor, autocorrelation, factor returns, time-series momentum."
