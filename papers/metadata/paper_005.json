  "abstract": "We build on the investment approach of Cochrane (1991, 1996) to develop an alternative factor model that uses the market factor, a size factor, an investment factor, and a profitability factor (the q-factor model). The q-factor model largely summarizes the cross-section of average stock returns. A comprehensive examination of nearly 80 anomalies shows that about one-half of the anomalies are insignificant in the broad cross-section of stocks, and the q-factor model fully captures about one-half of the significant anomalies. With the exception of momentum, the q-factor model outperforms the Fama-French three-factor and four-factor models across all the anomalies.",
  "conclusion_sign": "positive",
  "replicable": "yes",
  "notes": "Introduced the q-factor model based on investment theory. Uses four factors: Market, Size (ME), Investment (I/A), and Profitability (ROE). Provides a theoretical foundation for factor models based on corporate investment decisions. Successfully explains many anomalies better than traditional models, except momentum."
